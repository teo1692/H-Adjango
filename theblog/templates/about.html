<h1>About me:</h1>
<br>

<p>I think that without the History of our ancestors, or more closely, of our grandparents, we can't expect a future worth to be lived.</p>
<br>

<p>My name is Marco Leonardis and I am 30. I live in London since 2019. I come from Rome, Italy. Currently I am studying Archaeology at Birkbeck, University of London and, through this page, I would like to try to write about History and Archaeology. So, I am trying to be an History blogger.</p>
<br>

<p>I inherited my passion about History and archaeology come from my grandfather. He, since I was little, taught me how important was the History. That without it, the human being, can not understand some mechanisms like the evolution of languages or cultures. He wasn't an archaeologist but he was a man who lived, surrounded by books, in the culture of History.
 We need passion, ambition and positivity for studying every matters.</p>
<br>

<p>It's difficult to explain to those who don't walk in my shoes, but when I'm visiting a castle overlooking a city, or when I find myself in a city steeped in history (such as Rome, my home town), but also in a simple characteristic village, I feel like my eyes could, without effort, imagine what that place used to be and it's not anymore.
     It's like when we read a book and our mind creates the images one after the other.</p>
<br>

<p>I hope that you do not image me like a person that stay 24/7 on the books without other interests... no, I have a lot of passions, perhaps too many. For example, I love to travel and learn new things from them like culture, history and, why not, food as well. When I am in a place I like, in generally, move around it and not remain in the same place all time.</p>
<br>

<p>I would like to try to publish some photos made by myself with a description or a little essay about this as well. I canâ€™t say that I have a passion about photograph, but I like it.</p>
<br>

<p>I have done this page because, one day near or far away, I would like to be a good Archaeologist and I think that this my project can help me in this dream.
I hope that you will forgive me about any gaff. This is my first time and, sometime, the ideas inside my head are a vortex that I sometimes struggle to stop.
</p>
<br>

<p>Thank you for reading this little introduction about myself.</p>
